    product_intro_text3 = "The following attributes varied across the offers:"

    investment_cost = "<u>Purchase Price:</u>"
    electricity_cost = "<u>Electricity costs for driving:</u>"
    gasoline_cost = "<u>Gasoline costs for comparable car:</u>"
    new_used = "<u>New car or pre-owned car:</u>"
    range = "<u>Battery Range:</u>"
    adopters = "<u>Electric vehicle adoption in your income group:</u>"
    ice_sales_ban_adoption = "<u>Sales ban on new gasoline and diesel vehicles:</u>"

    investment_cost_text = "This financial attribute shows the <b>net price of the electric car</b>. There are government subsidies that can directly reduce the price. The cost depends on the car brand and the subsidies/discounts subtracted."
    electricity_cost_text = "An electric vehicle needs electricity for driving, which is typically cheaper per mile than gasoline and diesel. This attribute represents the <b>electricity costs per 100 miles driven</b> in this electric vehicle. The total costs are determined by the efficiency of the electric vehicle, the costs to produce and distribute the electricity, and governmental taxes."
    gasoline_cost_text = "This attribute represents the <b>gasoline costs per 100 miles driven</b> for a gasoline-fueled vehicle of comparable size to the electric vehicle of this offer. These costs are determined by the typical fuel efficiency of cars of this size, the costs to produce and distribute gasoline, and governmental taxes. By comparing the gasoline costs to the electricity costs of the electric vehicle, you can calculate how much money you would save each month by driving electric instead of gasoline."
    savings_text = "Charging an electric vehicles is <b>cheaper than fueling a gasoline car</b>. Therefore, the costs per mile are lower for electric vehicles than for gasoline cars. The savings are calculated by comparing electricity prices with gas prices and the efficiency of electric vehicles with traditional cars. <b>The value presented tells you how much you can save with this electric car for every 100 miles compared to gasoline and diesl vehicles.</b>"
    new_used_text = "This attribute specifies whether the electric car is being sold <b>as a new or used vehicle</b>. A new electric car has not been previously owned or used, whereas a used electric car has had a previous owner. Used cars often have a lower purchase price compared to the original model, but may involve some wear."
    range_text = "The battery range indicates the <b>distance an electric vehicle can travel on a single battery charge</b>. It indicates how many miles you can drive before you have to stop to charge the battery."
    adopters_text = "This attribute represents the <b>percentage of people within your income group who drive an electric car</b>."
    ice_sales_ban_adoption_text = "This attribute indicates whether there is a <b>sales ban on gasoline and diesel vehicles</b> starting from a certain year. Note that this ban will only apply to car <b>sales</b> and that it will still be legal to <b>drive</b> gasoline and diesel vehicles."
